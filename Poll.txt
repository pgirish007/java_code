Here’s a ready-to-use poll draft you can post internally for your Q5 developer team:

📊 Poll Title:
"GitHub Copilot – Is it Helping You Code Smarter?"

📝 Description:
We’ve been using GitHub Copilot for some time now, and it’s time to take a pulse check. Your feedback will help us decide how we continue using, refining, or replacing this tool. Please share your honest thoughts based on your day-to-day coding experience.

Think about:

Is Copilot making your work faster?

Is it improving code quality?

Is it helping you learn or just speeding up typing?

Any frustrations or blockers it causes?


📌 Poll Options:

1. Absolutely – Game Changer 🚀 (Massively improves my productivity and code quality)


2. Yes – Helpful 👍 (Improves my workflow, but not perfect)


3. Neutral – Meh 😐 (Sometimes useful, sometimes not)


4. Not Really – Limited Value 👎 (Doesn’t add much to my development process)


5. No – More Hindrance than Help 🛑 (Slows me down or causes issues)



💬 Optional Comment:
If you can, please add a quick note in the comments about:

Specific scenarios where Copilot shines for you

Situations where it fails or produces poor suggestions

Features you wish it had

If you want, I can also give you a more engaging, slightly humorous version so your developers are more likely to respond enthusiastically.
