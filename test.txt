As a core team member, I actively promoted GenAI within the organization by driving awareness and fostering adoption through various initiatives. I spearheaded knowledge-sharing sessions and workshops to educate teams on the potential of generative AI, showcasing its ability to automate tasks, enhance creativity, and streamline workflows. Additionally, I collaborated with different departments to identify areas where GenAI could be effectively integrated, providing hands-on support and demonstrating practical applications to solve business challenges. My efforts ensured that GenAI became a key innovation tool embraced across the organization.
